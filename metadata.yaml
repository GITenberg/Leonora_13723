description: Scathingly reviewed by some at the time of its publication in 1903 because
  of its subject matter, Bennett's third novel, Leonora , is the love story of a middle-aged
  woman. In response to his critics, Bennett later recorded in his preface to The
  Old Wives Tale , that he intended the book to be a protest against the "absurd youthfulness,
  the unfading youthfulness of the average heroine."
